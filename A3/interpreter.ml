open Str;;          (* for split *)
(* The Str library provides a few extra string-processing routines.
   In particular, it provides "split", which I use to break program
   input into whitespace-separated words.  Note, however, that this
   library is not automatically available.  If you are using the
   top-level interpreter, you have to say
        #load "str.cma";;
   before you say
        #use "interpreter.ml";;
   If you are generating an executable from the shell, you have to
   include the library name on the command line:
        ocamlc -o interpreter str.cma interpreter.ml

(*******************************************************************
   The main parse routine below returns a parse tree (or PT_error if
   the input program is syntactically invalid).  To build that tree it
   employs a simplified version of the "attribute stack" described in
   Section 4.5.2 (pages 50-55) on the PLP companion site.
  
   When it predicts A -> B C D, the parser pops A from the parse stack
   and then, before pushing D, C, and B (in that order), it pushes a
   number (in this case 3) indicating the length of the right hand side.
   It also pushes A into the attribute stack.
  
   When it matches a token, the parser pushes this into the attribute
   stack as well.
  
   Finally, when it encounters a number (say k) in the stack (as opposed
   to a character string), the parser pops k+1 symbols from the
   attribute stack, joins them together into a list, and pushes the list
   back into the attribute stack.
  
   These rules suffice to accumulate a complete parse tree into the
   attribute stack at the end of the parse.
  
   Note that everything is done functionally.  We don't really modify
   the stacks; we pass new versions to a tail recursive routine.
